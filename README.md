### description
This project develops a novel interactive tool that aims to provide a real-time audiovisual experience to the user. The envisioned objective of IAV is to expose people with limited movement capabilities or with a limited musical-domain background in general, to access a positive musical stimulus in a ridiculously simplified manner (such as moving hands) so that they could be motivated to get involved in art-making.

Future steps involve the development of the following additional features: 
    - enriched visualization (i.e. visualize FFT)
    - replace linear audio frequency transition with a grid of predefined notes.
    - add a drum transcription feature to enable the creation of rhythm patterns
